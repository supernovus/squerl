# Squerl

## Introduction

A nice implementation-independent SQL interface. Working with 'datasets'
as its fundamental abstraction, Squerl allows you to construct and
manipulate queries in a flexible way. Not really an ORM layer, it's more
of an abstraction of SQL specifics and platform differences.
